                  <br/>The players each write a n-digit secret number.
                    <br/>The digits must be all different. 
                      <br/>Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches.
                        <br/>The digits of the number guessed also must all be different.
                          <br/>If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "+", if in different positions, they are "-". Example:
                            </p>
                        <li>Secret number: 4271</li> 
                      <li>Opponent's try: 1234</li> 
                    <li>Answer: + 1  and - 2 . (The + is "2", the - are "4" and "1".)</li> 
                  <li>The first player to reveal the other's secret number wins the game.</li> <br/>
